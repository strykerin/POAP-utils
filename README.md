# Helper functions for the Proof of Attendance Protocol

- All POAPs are on one contract
- Each event/collection are associated to an eventID

> If I create an event and I get 10 POAPs for the attendees, then all the 10 individual tokens are mapped to the same eventId

## Running

Change the `address` variable from `22c1f6050e56d2876009903609a2cc3fef83b415` to the one you are interested in checking

```shell
npm install
ts-node .
```
